Answer 1. I don't have any coding expereince in the past and this is the first time
	    I will be using C as a language to enter in the programming world. 
          I am hoping for the best to learn from the lectures and also hand on practice at home.

Answer 2. So this is the first time I used MS visuals to write a program in c++ 
	    language. It was not quite easy as I am totally new to this language.
	    If I practice more and more and try to explore different things from the 
	    lab matrial, I will be good at it. 

Answer 3. My goal is to practice more and more untill I become a pro.
