Answer 1:  price one is deleclared as a float type. when its multiply 100 , its cast to 
	     an interger, so there is acloss of precision due to floating point representation.
	     double types(price 2, price 4) works because 'double' has higher precision
	     as compared to float. double type can represent value with great accuracy and wider range.
	     thats why, to get more precision we use double to reduce floating point issues.

Answer 2: int money = 7245;
          printf("1. $%.2lf\n", money / 100.0);
	    in the above code ...variable money is integer. then code perform division operation
	    and the variable integer changes it to  double.
	    this process is called promotion or implicit type conversion. 

		

 this above code, cast is applied to value 100 to change it to double. 100 to double
		and the result will be in double outcome.

Answer 3:  a) 3622 is the value of variable result.
		  truncation took place here. it result of loss of precision.

	     b)  value showed by the compiler is 1) $0.00
							     2) $72
							     3) $0.00
							     4) $72
	     c) in sample 1 there is problem with printf ..... instead of %.2lf , it should be %d.
		  in sample 3 there is problem with printf .......instead of %.2lf, it should be %d.
